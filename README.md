# Campus Event Scheduler – Part 2 (D2) Implementation

This branch (**d2-implementation**) contains the full implementation for Part 2 (D2).

We implemented the Repository, Service, and Strategy patterns, and separated Event and RSVP controllers according to the updated UML class diagrams and sequence diagrams.  
All business logic (Event creation, RSVP flow, guest list retrieval) is included in this branch.
